We want to help people tell stories that build shared understanding.

We need shared understanding to get things done—whether it’s to move public opinion, or to get buy-in to pursue an idea at work.

Shared understanding happens when you communicate an idea with someone, and they’re able to lock into the same mental model.

At work, slides are our go-to medium for creating shared understanding.

People make a lot of slides.
70% of knowledge workers make a deck at least once a week.
